Practicum IMAD
1.	The purpose of the app.
My HelpMePack app helps the user to pack when going for a vacation or even when the user is going to visit their relatives. Items can be grouped into logical categories like Clothing, Electronics or Toiletries. This structure makes packing more intuitive and avoids the chaos of a long, unsorted packing list. Including quantity features helps users track precise amounts and monitor luggage weight limits which is useful for avoiding overweight baggage fees.

2.	Design Considerations.
Simplicity.
The app does not need long sign-ups when using it. On the first screen, the user gets to type their packing items so that they can get to view their packing. The app has a clean design and the app has a typing bar where they get to add items on their packing list, which they would like to pack. There is a simple layout on the logo of the app, the app data words and simple and clear buttons too.

Consistency.
The app has clear colours, fonts and buttons. The app ensures features behave predictably across different screens. The words on the app has good spacing, margins and image sizes are standardized.

Readability.
Legible fonts were used and consistent font size was also used for my app name. The app buttons and app names stands with enough contrast. I avoided decorations. The app name font is large for easy scanning.

Feedback.
The app provides feedback when the user is done typing their own data, after that the user has to press the view packing list button to view their packing list.

Placement.
My app name is at the top of the screen, then the packing app logo follows. The users items that where typed will appear on the second screen when the user pressed the view packing list button. The app buttons are at the botton for the screen after the users own data.
